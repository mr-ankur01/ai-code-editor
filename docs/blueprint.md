## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted blue (#6699CC) to evoke calmness and focus, supporting long coding sessions.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), nearly white, to minimize eye strain and provide a clean coding environment.
- Accent color: Soft orange (#D9885D) to highlight interactive elements and AI-powered suggestions.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for clear, modern text rendering within the editor and UI.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) to improve readability of code blocks.
- Use minimalist, consistent icons from a library like 'Feather' to ensure clarity and reduce visual clutter.
- Implement subtle, non-distracting animations (e.g., fade-in effects) to enhance user experience without slowing down the workflow.
- Dark Theme: Use a dark color palette to reduce eye strain in low-light environments. Background color: #222; Text color: #EEE; Accent color: #D9885D.
